# The AV1 Video Codec

1 billion hours of video watched per day (just youtube)
    114,155 years (took 131,000 years to build a pyramid) 

NZ and EU abolished software patents "as such" 

## How does AV1 work? 

    1 takes input
    2 partitions input into blocks
    3 predict what comes next (by pixels or by previously processed frames)
    4 transform  and quantize 
    5 entropy coding, probabily of what the next coding is 
    6 reconstruct the image (looks a little worse since they threw away bits) 
    7 filter to clean up images 
    8 filter again 
    9 filter again 

## What makes AV1 different 

More!

AV1 vs VP9

    more partitioning

    intra prediction 
        predict from pixels gathered in more places
        filter pixels before prediction 
        56 directional modes
        6 non-directional modes
        5 recrusize filtering modes
        1 chroma-only mode

    inter prediction
        lots of fancy new updates to inter prediction as well 
         wedge codebook and rectuangular codebook
    
    tranforms
        4x more transforms 
         double transform sizes

    Quantization 
        didn't get that much more, but still more!

    Entroy coding
        multi-symbol artithmetic doing 
        alaphet size to 16 
        8 banks probabilities (one per reference frame) 
        adapt on every symbol 

    filtering
        deblocking filter
        constrainted direction enhancement filter
        loop restoration filter
            weiner filter
            self-guided restoration filter
        16 line buffers total 

    MORE
        flexible tiles (splitting frame to encode independently)
        "superresolution" 
        metadata
            colorspaces
            HDR
            buffer model 
        sill image format (AVIF)

AV1 Hardware
    probably 2020

AOM develops reference implementation libaom

"dav1d" by the open source community 
    * very fast! 

rav1e 
    * written in rust
    * faster than libaom 
    * better than libaom 
    * ideally at the same time
    * not done, not done for years

issues with rust
    * casting (ugly, holy god)
    * bounds checking, not really an issue 
    * 2-d Buffers 
        * rust borrow checker only allows one mutuable reference to an array at a time
        * has convience methods for splitting an array into idependent chunks
