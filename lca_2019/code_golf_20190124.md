# Executable Code Golf: Making Tiny Binaries for Constrained Systems

recreational computer programming in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code, that impliments a certain algorithm 

## executable code golf 

the compiled binary is the smallest possible 

e.g. 16 byte paint program written in 12 lines 


256B animations for art and code golf

right around 1K you can get a little more efficiency by compression the compiled binary 
    right around enough bits plus compression table to start thinking about coding with techniques that compress well 

Windows binary compression 
crinkley -1K to 16K 
kkrunchy tager >= 64K 

pro: 
    20% better than LZ
con:
    windows only!!

    target 4K binary size
    PAQ1 compression algorithm 
    link-time reordering + transformations to improve compression
    explore alternative encoding algorithms 

PAQ compression 
    family of arithmetic encoder alogrithms 
    for each bit estimate the likelyhood of it being 0 or 1, and use that probility to subdivide the current range:
            see slide for helpful graphic 
    many impimentation choices

context monitoring and context mixixng
    for each bit to decode, predict the probabilty from previous decoded bits

just decoded bit `b`, `c0` is the count of 0s and `c1` is the count of 1s:
```
         if b == 0: 
            c0 += 1
            if c1 > 2: 
                c1 = c1/2 + 1
        else:
            c1 += 1
            if c0 > 2:
                c0 = c0/2 + 1
```

## Why is this better than LZ?

combination of reasons:
    * arithmetic codeing can store (potentially tiny) fraction of a bit at a time
    * sprase n-gram context models can be better match machine code
    * weithts allow to favor highly predictive models can be tuned

Why
    security (if a bit gets messed up defintely won't execute)
    cost savings 
    reduce size (IOT)
