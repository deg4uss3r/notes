# Network Monitoring with AMP

AMP == Active Measurement Project 

    putting packets on the network and measuring how they behave 
        e.g. ping
    how quickly?
    how much? 
    who answers?
    what did they say?

Can interfere with "real" traffic on the network, and the own measturments too if they are not careful

Continous, distributed active network measurement
