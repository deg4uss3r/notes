# Using an Open Source SND controller to deploy a high-speed production network

Openflow API 

P4 Runtime - new just becoming a standard

"software-configured networking" (SCN) 

openflow replaces the control plane with openflow agent 

rules live in tables
    multiple tables let us impliment if-else-then logic 

Faucet - lightweight SDN controller
    openflow 1.3 
    can run on things as small as Raspberry pi
    supports layer 2 and layer 3

YAML format configs 

Gauge
    another controller similar to facuet 

worked with the super compute conference in Dallas to do the SDN (in parallel) of the largest temp network

    total capacity would be 9.008 Tbps! 

P4 

compiled control plane
